* Hook up UI audio
* Sheep states (get sad over time, reset when "caught", basically swap the idle animation)
* Teleporter mechanic
  * Flag on game data for whether or not sheep follow
    * OR make it a flag on the teleporter
* Jump mechanic
  * Allow platforming
  * Enable / disable on level object
* Level transition needs to despawn and then respawn players and anything else that carries through
  * Need to hold off on despawning sheep until behind transition screen
